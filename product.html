      <h3>The e-bike fully DIY: A fully functional pedelec e-bike assembled in 3 hours.</h3>
      <p>An e-bike is nothing new (especially in crowdfunding!), modularization is not new, but these two concepts have yet to be combined into a sophisticated, powerful machine. Through meticulous planning and design, the ultimate e-bike kit gives tinkerers and Do-it-yourself-ers the creative freedom and self satisfaction. The Sterka M1 is a high performance kit with custom features and modular adaptability. Once built, you can make adjustments on the bike to fit your specific riding style. Adjust suspension for rugged trails, swap tired for urban riding, or swap out parts for upgrades.</p>

    <div class="contentPerf">
      <h3>What about the performance ? The Sterka M1 is not just a kit-bike. </h3>
      <p>It’s a specialized high tech E-Bike that can compare to high-end E-Bikes in the market. Rather than a hub-mount, a mid drive motor drives the crank instead of the wheel itself, multiplying its power and allowing it to take advantage of the include Sturmey-Archer 5-gear internal hub transmission. The pedelec drive allows a more natural riding feel while also complimenting the rider’s strengths. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="contentDesign">
      <h3>A high performing pedelec bike deserves to look like a work of art.</h3>
      <p>We made sure the Sterka M1 is eye catching with a premium build and feel. A light frame was absolutely necessary so we built the Sterka M1 using carbon fiber sheets and #6061 Aluminum alloy Material shaped and cut by CNC machining. Final weight, including a charged battery rests at under 60lbs. Front and rear pneumatic shock absorbers provide comfort for any road conditions. Adjustable pre-load pressure corresponding to the rider’s weight, alleviate the impact caused by the road or trail surface.</p>
